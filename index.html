                <p>Welcome!
                    I am currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science at Delhi Technological University (DTU), where I am exploring my passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Research. My curiosity for solving complex problems and building innovative solutions drives me to go beyond the classroom.

                    Over time, I have built a strong foundation in web development, machine learning, and advanced mathematics. I see mathematics not just as a subject, but as a powerful skill a tool that enables us to push boundaries, develop models, and unlock endless possibilities in technology and research.

                    I am also working on projects designed to help students and learners, bridging the gap between technology and education. These projects have given me hands on experience in building practical, impactful solutions while strengthening my technical and problem solving abilities.

                    Beyond academics, I am actively involved in a DTU society, where I collaborate with like minded peers, exchange ideas, and learn continuously. This experience has helped me grow as a team player, sharpen my leadership qualities, and stay inspired by the energy of a vibrant community.

                    Looking ahead, my long-term goal is to become a Quantitative Researcher. I am committed to giving my best to prepare for this journey, and I look forward to opportunities where I can learn, contribute, and make a difference.

                    If my journey resonates with you, I would be glad to connect. Please feel free to reach out to me via LinkedIn or email.

                    Thank you for visiting my website and taking the time to know more about me.</p>

            <p><b><u>National Cadet Corps(NCC): </u></b> In 2021, I attended an NCC camp where I learned valuable skills such as shooting, teamwork, and discipline. I spent 15 unforgettable days at the camp with my friends, experiencing a lifestyle that truly resembled the life of a soldier. The lessons and memories from that camp still inspire me today.</p>
            <p><b><u>National Service Scheme(NSS):</u></b>In 2021, I had the opportunity to actively participate in the National Service Scheme (NSS) at RPVV Gandhi Nagar and the surrounding areas. Through this program, I engaged in several community-oriented activities that focused on social awareness, cleanliness, and helping underprivileged sections of society. One of the most impactful parts of this experience was taking part in cleanliness drives, where we worked as a team to promote hygiene and environmental responsibility. We also organized awareness campaigns to educate people about health, education, and the importance of social unity.

                Working with NSS taught me the value of selfless service and the power of collective effort. It was inspiring to see how small actions, when performed consistently, can create a positive impact on the community. The program also helped me improve my leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills as I interacted with people from diverse backgrounds. Spending time with fellow volunteers created a strong sense of teamwork and belonging, and it also gave me a deep sense of satisfaction by contributing to society. My experience with NSS in 2021 remains one of the most meaningful chapters of my journey, motivating me to continue serving the community in the future.</p>
